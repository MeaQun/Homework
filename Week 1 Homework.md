I found this article interesting because not only does it explain the language in simple terms, but also answeres my question whether the name has to do with the popular British show:
[What Is Python Used For? A Beginnerâ€™s Guide](https://www.coursera.org/articles/what-is-python-used-for-a-beginners-guide-to-using-python)

I find this image inspiring because it challenges me to broaden my perception of the skills I already possess and try to find overlaps with the new ones I'm gaining. I am a pretty decent crocheter and a solid knitter. While the application of mathematics in knitting and crocheting was always common sense - from simple stitch counting to geometrical organization of patterns - the idea of translating yarn into a binary code surprised me.
