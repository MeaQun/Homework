## Homework Week 4 - Python ##

1. **What does one need to do to use a _module_?**

    One needs to import the module into the code-base by using the import statement.

1. **Name a Module (not the DateTime Nodule) we looked at and write a line or 2 of code as an example using this module.**

    Math module is one of modules we looked at, apart from the DateTime. Makes the common calculator look like a mathematical prodigy. 

1. **What is a benefit of using _Exception handling_?**

    The rest of the program / code can be executed regardless of the error. We don't get hung up on the potential error, but we're still aware that there is one.

1. **What are the _4 components_ used for Python Exception Handling?**

    If I understand the quesion correctly, the four components are: try, except, else & finally.

1. **_NumPy arrays_ are like what Python data type?**

    Arrays are like listswithin [] with just one specified data type.

1. **What is one of the _main benefits_ of using NumPy arrays.**

    Size. They are much smaller and hence use less memory and are faster to process.

1. **What is one of the _main requirements_ about the 'dtype' of NumPy arrays?**

    The data has to be from the same type.

1. **Of the 10 _uses of NumPy_, name 2.**

    Mathematical operations, searching, sorting & counting.

1. **Name one of the other _libraries_ we'll use with NumPy?**

    Pandas.

1. **What is the _shape of NumPy arrays_?**

    1D, 2D, or 3D

1. **What is a _Tensor_?**

    Tensor is a 3D array, meaning it has 3 or more axes.

1. **Name a reason why it's better _using NumPy_ for Data Analysis than using a Python List?**

    Memory/storage & speed.

1. **When creating an _"empty" array_, where do the elements come from?**

    The elements come from the machine used to create the array.
